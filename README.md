# VS Code Profiles for C++ and Python
Visual Studio Code now support [profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles), which is a convenient way of sharing extensions and settings. To use them, select `Profiles: Import Profile...` in the command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`) and paste the url of the profile you want to import.
